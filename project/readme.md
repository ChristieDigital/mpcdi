Here is an example project

We have a "wolfhead" model (see miniWolfHeadTheoretical.obj) with 3 projectors projecting onto it.

![alt text][scene2]
![alt text][scene3]

[scene1]: https://github.com/tvaneerd/mpcdi/blob/master/project/snapshot_A.png "from above"
[scene2]: https://github.com/tvaneerd/mpcdi/blob/master/project/snapshot_B.png "straight on"
[scene3]: https://github.com/tvaneerd/mpcdi/blob/master/project/snapshot_C.png "angle shot"

The positions of the projectors can be found in the theoretical.mpcdi.xml MPCDI file.

The view (or rendering) from each of the projectors should be:

From Left Projector:

![alt text][view2]


From Center Projector:

![alt text][view3]


From Right Projector:

![alt text][view1]
