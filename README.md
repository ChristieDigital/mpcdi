Christie Digital's Mystique product line enables projection mapping by aligning multiple projectors onto a surface.

For 3D surfaces, Mystique can calculate the projector "poses" (position, orientation, lens properties, etc),
and export these poses for injestion into the Media Server playback device.  By rendering the content from the right pose,
the projection is aligned.

To export the data, Mystique uses Vesa standard MPCDI 2.0 xml files.

Some info and examples for helping Christie partners can be found here.
