The MPCDI spec is a VESA spec, and the full specification can be found online.

However, many have found the doc less than clear, so here is some additional notes; ie my understanding of the spec.

_These are NOT a substitute for reading and following the official VESA spec_

MPCDI the file, the zip, the mystery
----------

An MPCDI file is actually a zip file containing a XML file (typically called mpcdi.xml) and then warp and blend files, etc.

*HOWEVER* Mystique doesn't write out warp and blend info (we just send it directly to the projectors), so we only write out the XML file.  By convention, we use the extension `.mpcdi.xml`, so for the "foo" project, the file will be named `foo.mpcdi.xml`.  (The user can change the MPCDI filename and location from the Mystique UI.)


_The rest of this document is about the MPCDI XML format and the information that Mystique exports to that file_

Header
--------

As mentioned, it's XML:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <MPCDI profile="sl" geometry="2" color="1" date="2018-11-16 19:30:11" version="2.0">

It's MPCDI version 2.0.  For 3D, we use the "sl" (shader lamp) profile, which means we will export projector "poses" (position, orientation, etc) via the `<region>` node (see below).

Overall structure
--------

Next in the XML is a single `<display>` node, which describes the scene.  Within the display there _could be_ multiple `<buffer>` nodes (ie for projecting on completely separate surfaces/objects) but, really, it can all be done with a single buffer, so, by convention, Mystique just writes a single `<buffer>` and sets the buffer id to the name of the Mystique file of the project.

Within a buffer, there are multiple `<region>` nodes - basically one for each projector.

    <display>
        <buffer id="wolf_90_markerless.cal">
            <region id="Staging Projector_01" xResolution="1400" yResolution="1050" x="0" y="0" xsize="1" ysize="1">
            ...
            </region>
            <region...>
            ...
            </region>
            <region...>
            ...
            </region>
        </buffer>
    </display>

All the good info (ie per-projector info) is in the `<region>` nodes.

`<region>`
---------

A region looks like:

            <region id="Staging Projector_01" xResolution="1400" yResolution="1050" x="0" y="0" xsize="1" ysize="1">
                <frustum>
                    <yaw>-54.649008076582298</yaw>
                    <pitch>30.086445865802251</pitch>
                    <roll>-35.258246325136348</roll>
                    <rightAngle>26.536123041449411</rightAngle>
                    <leftAngle>-26.579532980277939</leftAngle>
                    <upAngle>20.556835397199524</upAngle>
                    <downAngle>-20.543387795160175</downAngle>
                </frustum>
                <coordinateFrame>
                    <posx>0.99906</posx>
                    <posy>-0.70781</posy>
                    <posz>-0.70934</posz>
                    <yawx>0.00000</yawx>
                    <yawy>0.00000</yawy>
                    <yawz>-1.00000</yawz>
                    <pitchx>1.00000</pitchx>
                    <pitchy>0.00000</pitchy>
                    <pitchz>0.00000</pitchz>
                    <rollx>0.00000</rollx>
                    <rolly>1.00000</rolly>
                    <rollz>0.00000</rollz>
                </coordinateFrame>
            </region>


The `<frustum>` defines the projector's orientation, and its field of view. See below.  
The `<coordinateframe>` defines the projector's position... and is complicated. See below.  

Let's look at each part.


`<coordinateframe>`
------------

The `<coordinateframe>` node in the MPCDI xml spec is not... obvious:

    <coordinateFrame>
        <posx>1.76840</posx>
        <posy>-2.25391</posy>
        <posz>3.21997</posz>
        <yawx>0.00000</yawx>
        <yawy>0.00000</yawy>
        <yawz>-1.00000</yawz>
        <pitchx>1.00000</pitchx>
        <pitchy>0.00000</pitchy>
        <pitchz>0.00000</pitchz>
        <rollx>0.00000</rollx>
        <rolly>1.00000</rolly>
        <rollz>0.00000</rollz>
    </coordinateFrame>



Section 2.2.2:
> “Positions can simply be expressed as a 3D point. Each of the 3D vectors relates to the Section 2.2
> definitions provided for yaw, pitch, and roll. They will be expressed as orthonormal unit vectors for
> each of the yaw, pitch, and roll directions. (See Figure 2-2 for a graphical representation of these
> unit vectors.)”

That's not much to go on.  By what is now convention, Mystique uses `<coordinateframe>` as so:

The intent of the node is to communicate where the object (ie projector) is, but that should just be 3 numbers:

        <posx>1.76840</posx>
        <posy>-2.25391</posy>
        <posz>3.21997</posz>

The other numbers explain "where" those numbers are.  ie for `<posx>`, _which way is x?_

"Figure 2-2" is this picture of an airplane:

![alt text][airplane]


Now imagine that we've turned the plane so that it is facing into the computer screen.

ie the airplane (and Roll Axis) is facing “forward”,
and you - or the audience - are sitting in the plane,
and you and the plane are facing the screen or object we want to project onto.
(similarly, when designing in 3D software, imagine forward is _into_ the computer screen).

Now, in this scenario, the Pitch Axis arrow is pointing to the right - let's call that the X axis (as everyone seems to agree X is to the right).
So we encode that into the `<coordinateframe>`:

        <pitchx>1.00000</pitchx>
        <pitchy>0.00000</pitchy>
        <pitchz>0.00000</pitchz>

This says _the tip of the Pitch Axis arrow_ is at (1,0,0). And we know Pitch is to the right, so X is to the right! (And the arrow is one unit in length.)

We have now defined what "X", for `posx`, means!

Now the tricky parts - up and forward.  For many OpenGL-based systems, Y is up and -Z is forward.  This would give:

        <yawx>0.00000</yawx>
        <yawy>-1.00000</yawy> // Y is up, so -1 because Yaw axis points down
        <yawz>0.00000</yawz>
        <rollx>0.00000</rollx>
        <rolly>0.00000</rolly>
        <rollz>-1.00000</rollz> // -Z is forward

HOWEVER  Mystique uses a “surveyor” system, where **Z is up, Y is forward, and X is to the right.**

To encode the Mystique coordinate system, we fill out the coordinateFrame with:

        <yawx>0.00000</yawx>
        <yawy>0.00000</yawy>
        <yawz>-1.00000</yawz>  // Yaw arrow points down, -Z is down, so +Z is up
        <pitchx>1.00000</pitchx>
        <pitchy>0.00000</pitchy>
        <pitchz>0.00000</pitchz>
        <rollx>0.00000</rollx>
        <rolly>1.00000</rolly>  // Roll ie forward is Y
        <rollz>0.00000</rollz>

ie the tip of Yaw axis arrow is at (0,0,-1) ie -1 in Z, ie positive Z is up
the tip of the Pitch axis arrow is at (1,0,0) ie 1 in X, as X is to the right (as always)
the tip of the Roll axis (ie forward) is at (0,1,0) ie Y is forward

So now we know that the position:

        <posx>1.76840</posx>
        <posy>-2.25391</posy>
        <posz>3.21997</posz>

means

        <posx>1.76840</posx> // to the right
        <posy>-2.25391</posy> // negative, so step back 2.25391 units (meters typically) from screen
        <posz>3.21997</posz> // up


To convert to a Y-up, -Z-forward system, you need to remap based on that coordinateFrame.
ie from Mystique to Y-up, -Z-forward you could do:

    tmp = Z;
    Z = -Y;
    Y = tmp;

But in general, you form a matrix from the MPDCI coordinateFrame to your coordinate frame.

Another way to look at it:

Since the Roll axis determines forward, then:

    forward = posx * rollx  +  posy * rolly  +  posz + rollz;

Similarly:

    up = -(posx * yawx  +  posy * yawy  +  posz + yawz); // neg - Yaw points down
    right = posx * pitchx  +  posy * pitchy  +  posz + pitchz;

which you can then move into your x,y,z system.



`<frustum>`
-------

`<frustum>` describes which way the projector is facing, as well as its field of view.

                <frustum>
                    <yaw>-54.649008076582298</yaw>
                    <pitch>30.086445865802251</pitch>
                    <roll>-35.258246325136348</roll>
                    <rightAngle>26.536123041449411</rightAngle>
                    <leftAngle>-26.579532980277939</leftAngle>
                    <upAngle>20.556835397199524</upAngle>
                    <downAngle>-20.543387795160175</downAngle>
                </frustum>
                
The `yaw`, `pitch`, and `roll` are angles (in degrees) around the axes as shown in the airplane diagram.  Note the direction of the arrows.  Also note the order: from the point of view of the _pilot_, 

1. first the plane (or projector) is turned left/right by `yaw` degrees, where positive is a turn to the right.
2. then the plane/projector is tilted up by `pitch` degrees
3. then the plane/projector is rolled along its axis - ie a positive roll is raising the left wing while lowering the right wing

(if all 3 of `(yaw, pitch, roll)` are 0, the plane/projector is facing forward along the roll axis.  ie "into" the screen of the computer, or towards the surface being projected on)


### `<rightAngle>` et al

The 4 angles form a field of view of the projected light.  Positive angles are to the right and up.

Looking down at a planar projection from above,

`L` is the `<leftAngle>`  - note this is likely negative
`R` is the `<rightAngle>`  
`t` is the throw distance  
`e` is the distance to the left (resulting from `leftAngle`)  
`r` is the distance to the right (resulting from `rightAngle`)  
`h` is the horizontal offset distance  
`w` is the width of the screen  



![alt text][frustum]

Let's do some math:

```
tanL = -e/t  (as L in the diagram would be negative)
tanR = r/t

e = -t * tanL
r = t * tanR

e + r = w
-t*tanL + t*tanR = w
t (tanR - tanL) = w
tanR - tanL = w/t

let T = throw-ratio = t/w 

T = 1 / (tanR - tanL)
```

OK, from left and right angles, we have the throw ratio.  We also need the lens offset:

```
h = horz offset (as distance, not percent)
From the diagram:
	r - h = w/2
	e + h = w/2
Thus:
        r - h = e + h
Recall r = t*tanR and e = -t*tanL
Sub:
	t*tanR – h = -t*tanL + h
Rearrange:
	h = t(tanR+tanL)/2
Recall: T = t/w  ie  t = Tw
Sub:
	h = Tw(tanR+tanL)/2
And (from above): T = 1/(tanR-tanL)
Sub:
	h = (1/(tanR-tanL))w(tanR+tanL)/2
ie
	        w(tanR + tanL)
	h =  -------------------
	        2(tanR - tanL)

Typically lens offset is represented as a percent of half-width:
	h% = h/(w/2)
	h% = (tanR + tanL)/(tanR - tanL)
    
Similarly, vertical offset:
    v% = (tan(Up) + tan(Down)/(tan(Up) - tan(Down))
```
